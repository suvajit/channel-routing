High performance multi layer channel routing

The channel routing problem (CRP) is the problem of computing a feasible route for the nets so that the number of tracks required (and hence the channel area) is minimized. We assume that the routing wires do not extend beyond the left and right ends of the channel. Therefore, in order to minimize the routing area the horizontal wire segments of the nets need to be distributed amongst a minimum number of tracks. This process of assignments of the horizontal wire segments to tracks is guided by two important constraints viz., the horizontal constraints and the vertical constraints that we have discussed in previous section.
